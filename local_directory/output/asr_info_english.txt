are we may train on the assumption that are television remote control may have features which could be on the television.
or are we keeping like design commitment to television features.
new remote control as you can see this be original trendy and user friendly.
the y and so there are three different stages to the design and i'm laurie what would you guys have already received in your emails what.
so cost like production cost is twelve fifty the selling price.
got the project announcement that designing a remote control.
so that you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of.
so current a brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro i'm we're aiming to make fifty million euro.
or just like basic product that is positioning twenty five euro remote control might be a big hit in london might.
marketing get more control over it should be writing all this time.
i've never bought a remote controls are you how it how good a remote control but.
here interesting thing about discussing the production remote control for me is that we as you point.
out as don't think remote controls being summoned something people consciously s f s in the purchasing habits.
i one we look at a be the people producing television set maybe they have to buy a remote control is.
is another way is maybe people had t v set a really set up with their remote control and they really want.
in time but i'm more controls because the fed up of having four five different calls for each ten times.
so like i wonder if we might add something new to the remote control market.
so they will work actually function together but i differ remote controls.
so this to wrap up the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes so that's point about ten to twelve by my watched.
so in between nine and as the industrial designer you're gonna be working on that's a working design of that so.
